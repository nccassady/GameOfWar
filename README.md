# Game of War
This is an implementation of the card game War in Ruby.

## Running
If you have ruby, you can download the source code and run the script with
> ruby game.rb

If you don't have Ruby installed on your machine, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/nccassady/GameOfWar/releases/download/v0.1.0/game.exe) in executable form through GitHub and run that like any other program.

After running, this script creates a file called "GameOfWar.txt" that is the result of each round of the game. If you run the script again, it will overwrite that file.
